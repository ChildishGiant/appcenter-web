# appage
A page for your app

To rebuild the app list, run:

```shell
ruby appage.rb
```

## TODO:

- Icons
- Combining with the redirect so the experience on elementary OS stays the same
- Clean up styling to more closely match the AppCenter client
- Figure out multiple screenshots
- A better homepage
- Automate updating the app list
