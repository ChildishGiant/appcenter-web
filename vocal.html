		<h2>Audio and Video Podcast Support</h2>
		<p>Subscribe, browse, and listen to any podcast - audio or video.</p>

		<h2>Custom Skip Intervals</h2>
		<p>Have you ever missed something and wanted to skip back 10 seconds, or jump forward 2 full minutes to breeze past an advertisement? Set custom time intervals for the skip forward and backward buttons.</p>

		<h2>Full System Integration</h2>
		<p>Between native notifications, launcher count and progress bar support, system media keys, and sound menu integration, Vocal feels right at home in elementary OS.</p>

		<h2>Library Importing and Exporting</h2>
		<p>Automatically create your library by importing existing libraries from iTunes, gPodder, and other podcast clients, or create a new library by adding your own feeds. Plus, should you decide to try something else, you can take all your data with you.</p>

		<h2>Streaming and Downloading</h2>
		<p>Stream episodes without the need for a download, or save them for offline listening or permanent archival.</p>

		<h2>Automatic Downloads</h2>
		<p>Vocal automatically checks for and downloads new episodes in the background, so your library is always up-to-date.</p>

		<h2>Smart Library Management</h2>
		<p>Never worry about old downloads filling up your hard disk! Vocal periodically cleans your library so the freshest content is always available, while also keeping the cruft out.</p>

		<h2>Episode Position Saving</h2>
		<p>Vocal remembers exactly where you were in each episode, so it can start back right where you left off.</p>

		<h2>And much more...</h2>
