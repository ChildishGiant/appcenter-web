<p>Write.as is a simple writing tool and publishing platform. There&apos;s no sign up â€” just open the app, write something, and publish.</p>
<p>Published posts get a secret, unique link on Write.as that you can share with anyone, or keep to yourself. In either case, you remain private because we don&apos;t collect personal information about you.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple, distraction-free editor built for your words</li>
  <li>Instantly launches to a blank page or your last draft</li>
  <li>Writing automatically saves as you type</li>
  <li>Work on a single local draft, then publish or save as another file when you&apos;re finished</li>
  <li>Choose from three different fonts: serif, sans-serif, or monospace</li>
  <li>Dark mode on platforms that support it</li>
  <li>Publish to Write.as and share your post (example)</li>
  <li>Manage published posts with the built-in command-line interface</li>
</ul>
