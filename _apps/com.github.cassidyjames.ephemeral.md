<p>Browse the Internet in private without leaving a trace of history on your computer. Ephemeral is a stripped down private browser that&apos;s perfect for avoiding persistent cookies or web trackers. Close the window and all traces of your browsing are removed from your device.</p>
<p>Handy features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easily open pages in any other installed browser</li>
  <li>Search right from the URL bar</li>
  <li>Set as your default browser for true privacy by default</li>
  <li>Hit Ctrl+W to close the current window or Ctrl+Q to quit all windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Ephemeral protects you in three key ways:</p>
<p>1️⃣ Always incognito. From the second you open an Ephemeral window until you close it (or hit the Erase button), Ephemeral is in private browsing mode. That means history, cookies, local storage, passwords, etc. are all blown away as soon as you leave.</p>
<p>2️⃣ Sandboxed. Every Ephemeral window is a separate instance of the browser engine. This means pages are kept separate from one another. Sign into a service in one window, and other Ephemeral windows will have no idea you’re signed in.</p>
<p>3️⃣ No third-party cookies. Out of the box, Ephemeral blocks cookies from third-party sources. This cuts down on advertising cookies and other unwanted forms of cross-site tracking.</p>
<p>Ephemeral also uses DuckDuckGo — the search engine that doesn’t track you — by default to avoid as much Google tracking as possible.</p>
<p>What if you run into a site compatibility issue due to the tracking prevention, or if you want to sign into a site using another browser’s saved passwords? Ephemeral has you covered: just hit your other browser’s icon in the header and the current page is opened up there.</p>
<p>The best part of Ephemeral comes when you use it as your default browser: make privacy a habit by opening links in a private browser by default, knowing you can always jump back into a less private browser with one click.</p>
