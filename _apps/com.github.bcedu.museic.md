<p>MuseIC is a fast and simple music player with remote control from any device through internet browser.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Play music files and add them to music library</li>
  <li>Sort by name, artis and album (it handles ID3 metadata tags)</li>
  <li>Connect to the address given by MuseIC and control the media from any device (mobile phone, tablet, etc.) with a
web browser</li> </ul>
<p>Any resemblance between the name and some awesome music band is pure coincidence.</p>
